# developer_guide.txt

'trains.csv' file has the following information
trainNo,trainName,D0,D1,D2,D3,D4,D5,D6,startTime,firstStationNo,speed,noOfCoachA,noOfCoachB,noOfCoachC,fair/km,lastStationNo

'stations.csv' file has the follwoing information
stationNo,stationName,distuptoNextStation





What I have learned from this project :
1. Use of module to make things easier
2. First write down your vision
3. Write Logics
4. Write small chunks of code and then test it
5. Make test cases and test it
6. Create 'developer_guide.txt'
7. Create 'user_guide.txt'
8. Create 'Log.txt' to generate logs of the application
9. Short cuts of pycharm (rename : shift + F6) (comment : ctrl + /)
10. Research on the topic of project
11. Think about frontend
12. Think how backend should work : Database concept, admin concept etc.
13. Write codes in such a way that it should be reused.
14. Document all the codes and logic, try print('[DEBUG] for debugging purpose ...')
    Making more sense with
    a. variable name
    b. method/function name
    c. comment
15. Apply the concept of "SDLC"
16. Be careful of python type error (python is not strongly typed)


Research on the Project "Train Ticket Booking" application :
1. Seached how the application works
2. created "trains.txt", "stations.txt" keeping in mind that these are object. Using these files as tables of DBMS
3. Using module to separate all relevant code/logic so that in future it can be updated
4. My plan is to use html and css for front end of the application so in future I'll be able to use all the codes and use all functions as APIs
   Will take data from CSS and provide input to the methods
5. Testing each methods so that the progress would be fine.


What I should learn :
1. SDLC
2. How developers actually brainstorm about application before even writing code.
3. How to document things properly
4. Create Log.txt (Error, Warning...)
5. More on python


Short-cut :
1. Hit ctrl+shift+F10 to run.
2. Hit shift+F6 to change variable names in all places.
3. ctrl+p for getting suggestion for parameters.
