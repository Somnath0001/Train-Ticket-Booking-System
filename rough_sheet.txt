PNR (pnrNo, pName, pAge, pGender, seatNo, journeyDate, journeyDuration, journeyStartTime,
     journeyEndTime, BoardingStation, DeboardingStation, trainNo, bookingStatus, isFoodOrdered )

PNR Number Properties :
-----------------------
1. PNR number should be of 10 digits.
2. First 3 digits should represent zone.
3. Last 7 should be unique.
Eg. : 123-4567890

There should be a method : pnrNoGenerator()
It will generate random 7 numbers and conbine with first 3 numbers

Booking process :
-----------------
user -> searches available trains -> checks seat availability -> select seat -> comes to booking page
-> fills passanger details -> comes to payment page -> pays the fair amount -> his/her seat is booked
-> Ticket got generated/printed -> he should be able to check booking status in his booking dashboard

Login Page -> Train Search Page -> Booking Page -> Payment Page -> Ticket Print Page -> user Dashboard

Have already created logic for train availabilty search
Create module "seatAvailability.py" to work on seat availability search
Need to create method for seatAvailabilitySearch() which will return available seats of the trains
coachASeatAvailability() -> return total available seats of coachA
coachBSeatAvailability() -> return total available seats of coachB
coachCSeatAvailability() -> return total available seats of coachC

Logic behind seat availability :
1. For the train list all seats which are not booked.
2. From the above list, divide seats for 3 type of coaches.
3. return the count

TrainNo -> 5 digits
CoachType -> 1 digit (1-coachA, 2-coachB, 3-coachC)
CoachNo -> 2 digits (1 - 99)
seatNo -> 2 digits (1 - 99)
So
uniqueSeatNo -> 10 digits (trainNo, coachType, coachNo, seatNo)

bookSeat()
This method should make
1. Choose a seat from available seat
2. set "isBooked = True"
3. set fromTime
4. set toTime
5. set bookedFrom
6. set bookedUpto

A PNR number for a specific Journey gets flushed 5 days after the date of journey. A flushed PNR means that its status cannot be checked online.
